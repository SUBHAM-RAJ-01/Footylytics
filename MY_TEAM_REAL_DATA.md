# My Team - Real Data Integration

## ✅ What's Updated

The My Team page now uses **real, live data** from the Football-Data.org API!

## 🎯 Real Data Features

### 1. Team Information

- **Squad Size** - Actual number of players in the team
- **Founded Year** - Real founding year of the club
- **Active Competitions** - Current competitions the team is playing in
- **Team Crest** - Official team logo

### 2. Upcoming Matches

- **Real Fixtures** - Actual scheduled matches from the API
- **Opponent Details** - Team names and crests
- **Match Dates & Times** - Accurate match schedules
- **Home/Away Status** - Correct venue information
- **Competition Names** - Actual league/tournament names

### 3. Match Display

Shows up to 5 upcoming matches with:

- Opponent team crest
- Opponent name
- Competition (Premier League, Champions League, etc.)
- Home/Away badge (green for home, blue for away)
- Match date and time

## 🔧 How It Works

### Frontend (MyTeam.jsx)

```javascript
// Fetches real data when team is selected
const fetchTeamData = async () => {
  // Get team info (squad, founded, competitions)
  const teamInfo = await axios.get(`/api/teams/${teamId}`);

  // Get team matches (past and future)
  const matches = await axios.get(`/api/teams/${teamId}/matches`);
};
```

### Backend (teams.js)

```javascript
// Team info endpoint
GET /api/teams/:teamId
→ Returns: squad, founded, competitions, crest, etc.

// Team matches endpoint
GET /api/teams/:teamId/matches
→ Returns: all matches (past and future)
```
